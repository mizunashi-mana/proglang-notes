abstract = {ML modules are a powerful language mechanism for decomposing programs into reusable components. Unfortunately, they also have a reputation for being “complex” and requiring fancy type theory that is mostly opaque to non-experts. While this reputation is certainly understandable, given the many non-standard methodologies that have been developed in the process of studying modules, we aim here to demonstrate that it is undeserved. To do so, we present a novel formalization of ML modules, which defines their semantics directly by a compositional “elaboration” translation into plain System F $\omega$ (the higher-order polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus). To demonstrate the scalability of our “F-ing” semantics, we use it to define a representative, higher-order ML-style module language, encompassing all the major features of existing ML module dialects (except for recursive modules). We thereby show that ML modules are merely a particular mode of use of System F $\omega$ .},

abstract = {We give a categorical semantics to the call-by-name and call-by-value versions of Parigot's $\lambda$$\mu$-calculus with disjunction types. We introduce the class of control categories, which combine a cartesian-closed structure with a premonoidal structure in the sense of Power and Robinson. We prove, via a categorical structure theorem, that the categorical semantics is equivalent to a CPS semantics in the style of Hofmann and Streicher. We show that the call-by-name $\lambda$$\mu$-calculus forms an internal language for control categories, and that the call-by-value $\lambda$$\mu$-calculus forms an internal language for the dual co-control categories. As a corollary, we obtain a syntactic duality result: there exist syntactic translations between call-by-name and call-by-value that are mutually inverse and preserve the operational semantics. This answers a question of Streicher and Reus. {\textcopyright} 2001, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},
